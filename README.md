# Mathematical Modeling

This repository is aimed at modeling the games and puzzles in the book "Puzzles and Games: A mathematical Modeling Approach" by Tony Hürlimann.
The solutions will most likely be different, and implemented using Python 3 and the Gurobi Optimizer (via the 'gurobipy' API).

The main goal of this repository is for you to try to solve the problems on your own first, and then look at the solution only when you are stuck.

## What is modeling?
A mathematical model is a simplified, assumption-based reflection of reality written in mathematics. We build models so that we can understand, predict or optimize what happens in the real world.

Modeling is the creative process of testing, refining and ultimately creating such models.
In the words of Tony Hürlimann, "The modeling process itself is often as important as the model because its discovery path teaches us more about the problem than the resulting model."

## Quick Start
1. **Install Gurobi**
    - 'https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python' Follow the steps in the links to install gurobi.
2. **Clone**
    - Clone this repository
3. **Read the problem**
    - Each file has a problem description at the beginning. Read the problem, and try to figure out the solution.
4. **Run the solution**
    - After figuring out the solution, code it and run, or run the already provided code.
