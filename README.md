# Mathematical Modeling

This repository is aimed at modeling the games and puzzles in the book "Puzzles and Games: A mathematical Modeling Approach" by Tony Hürlimann.
The solutions will most likely be different, and implemented using Python 3 and the Gurobi Optimizer (via the 'gurobipy' API).

A mathematical model is a simplified, assumption-based reflection of reality written in mathematics. We build models so that we can understand, predict or optimize what happens in the real world.

Modeling is the creative process of testing, refining and ultimately creating such models.
In the words of Tony Hürlimann, "The modeling process itself is often as important as the model because its discovery path teaches us more about the problem than the resulting model."

### Quick Start
